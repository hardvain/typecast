            <p>Haskell is a pure, lazy functional programming language with strong static typing. In particular, it is a
                polymorphically statically typed, lazy, purely functional language, quite different from most other
                programming languages. The language is named for Haskell Brooks Curry, whose work in mathematical logic
                serves as a foundation for functional languages. Haskell is based on the lambda calculus, hence the
                lambda we use as a logo. The first version of Haskell ("Haskell 1.0") was launched in 1990.</p>

            <h2>What is a functional programming language?</h2>

            <p>A language is said to be a functional programming language if it satisfies all of the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Immutability,</li>
                <li>First Class Functions,</li>
                <li>Referential Transparency,</li>
                <li>Purity,</li>
                <li>Lazy Evaluation,</li>
                <li>Recursion.</li>
            </ol>


            <p>In a functional programming language (like Haskell), programs are executed by evaluating expressions in
                contrast with imperative programming where programs are composed of statements which change the global
                state when executed. Now what does that mean? Lets take an example. Suppose you go on a trip to India.
                You find the place very soothing and think that drinking a tea now would be like the icicng on the cake.
                You have two options.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Go to your kitchen, take all the necessary utensils and ingredients, prepare the tea, heat it and
                    enjoy it by drinking, or you can
                </li>
                <li>Go to a shop nearby and ask the person to prepare you a tea and you can enjoy.</li>
            </ol>


            <p>The second style is called as functional programming whereas the first style is called imperative
                programming. Functional programming provides you an higher level of abstraction where you can tell the
                computer what it needs to do and then the computer finishes the task by itself. In an imperative
                programming style, we will tell the computer how to do, and the so called super intelligent computer
                follows your instructions as said. As you can see here, functional programming tries to use the
                intelligence of a computer where ever possible and thus avoids many mistakes which our human minds make.
                Having said this, functional programming is not where you enter a text like <code>I need an admin system
                    with logging capabilities for a large scale IT organization</code> and the computer automagically
                creates an application, deploys itself in a server and finally present you with an URL pointing the
                application. No. It is not like that. Lets see what I meant by telling computer what to do vs telling it
                how to do.</p>

            <p>Consider a scenario where we have an array of names. Our job is to filter the names starting with
                alphabet <code>D</code>. No particular language syntax is followed below. Consider it as a pseudo code.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><p>Imperative style:</p>

<pre><code>var names = ["Sachin", "Dravid","Ganguly","Dhoni", "Dhawan","Kohli","Yuvraj"]
    var namesStartingInD = []
    foreach(var name in names){
    if(name.StartsWith('D')){
    namesStartingInD.add(name)
    }
    }
    println(namesStartingInD)
</code></pre>
                </li>
                <li><p>Functional style:</p>

<pre><code>var names = ["Sachin", "Dravid","Ganguly","Dhoni", "Dhawan","Kohli","Yuvraj"]
    var namesStartingInD = names.filter(_.startsWith('D'))
    println(namesStartingInD)
</code></pre>
                </li>
            </ul>


            <p>As you can see that not only the imperative version is bigger, verbose and comparitively difficult to
                comprehend, the functional version is shorter and easily comprehensible. What we are doing here? We have
                a list of string, we filter it based on some criteria. The computer knows that when u filter a list, you
                will get another list (an empty list in the worst case). Then why should I tell the computer to create
                an empty list and fill the values in it when it already knows that? This si what I meant by telling the
                computer what to do and not how to do. It seems that surprisingly in most of the cases it is true. i.e.
                the computer has the intelligence to predict what to do and how to do. Its enough we guide it. This is
                the essence of functional programming. In the functional example the <code>_</code> is bound to every
                name in the <code>names</code> array as it is iterated.</p>

            <p>Now there are few basic rules / guidelines which if we follow, will aid the computer to predict and
                understand our requirement easily. These are the features upon which functional programming languages
                operate upon. Haskell supports all of those which we are going to see and infact it enforces we follow
                those things. This is the reason haskell is called a pure functional programming language.</p>

            <h2>1. Immutability</h2>

            <p>A programming language is useless without the ability to store values in some place and then read it
                later. We usually call this as variables. Variables usually have a value attached to them pointing to a
                reference in the memory. Usually we assign values to the variables, pass it to a function and then
                modify its contents as and when required. Modification of the value can of two types. 1. Type safe and
                2. Not type safe. Statically typed languages like C# and Java are type safe and will not allow you to
                assign a string to a variable of type int. Where as dynamic languages like Ruby, Python, Javascript etc
                are not type safe and allow you to assign any value of any type to any variable. It seems that both of
                these mechanisms are not encouraged in functional programming.</p>

            <p>Woah... wait... If I am not allowed to modify the contents of a variable, how am I going to update it?
                How am I going to convey the result of a calculation to someone fucntion? Am I going to create a new
                variable every time I need to modify? Wont that increase the memory consumption and hamper the
                performance? Well it seems there are better ways to achieve all of the above. Lets see that.</p>

            <p>In generaly mutability is the process of mutating a variable (changing the value associated with a
                variable). This is not allowed in haskell and functional programming languages in general. Why so? Lets
                see an example.</p>

<pre><code>public List&lt;String&gt; GetAndPrintDetails(names){
    var details = detailsService.GetDetails(names)
    printingService.PrintDetails(details)
    return details
    }
</code></pre>

            <p>The above code is a pseudo code. Consider all the variables to be a mutable one. i.e. their values can be
                changed any number of times anywhere. It has a method called <code>GetAndPrintDetails</code> with a
                parameter called <code>names</code> passed into it. We get the details of all the people by using <code>DetailsService</code>
                and then print the details suing <code>PrintingService</code>. After printing we return the details to
                the caller. This does the task perfectly. But is it not buggy? Well, lets see what are the ways in which
                this can break.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>We pass the details variable to <code>PrintingService</code>. Ideally it is supposed to only print
                    the data and do nothing. What if the <code>PrintingService</code> by mistake removes some of the
                    details? Can we guatantee that it wont do so? Yes if it is our code, No if it is from a library.
                    Even if it is our code, we need to make sure that <code>PrintingService</code> works propery in
                    order to make sure our method works properly.
                </li>
                <li>Also during testing of the code, we need to test the <code>PrintingService</code> correctly and then
                    also we need to make sure that all method calls from our method are tested.
                </li>
            </ol>


            <p>Both of the above problems can be avoided if the variables are immutable which means that once a value is
                associated with a variable, it can never be changed. The <code>PrintingService</code> can not change the
                value of <code>details</code>. This eliminates the first problem. Also for testing it is enough if we
                test the final result of a method because we can be sure that none of the internal calls will have
                changed our variable. Well it should not be called as <code>variable</code> because its value cant be
                changed, but I have stuck to that for the understanding of those coming from imperative background.</p>

            <h3>Persistent Data Structures</h3>

            <p>Ok. This solves two good problems. But what about the memory problem? Well it may be small overhead to
                create copies of individual variables, but what about lists? What about a list containing a million
                records? If I am to modify even one of those, should I create a copy of it? That would be a huge memory
                problem. Isnt it? Well ya. Yes it is a problem. But this problem has been tackled by the usage of
                persistent data structures. Woah. Wait. What is a persistent Data Structure?</p>

            <p>Let us say that we have an array of integers.</p>

<pre><code>var integerArray = [1,2,3,4]
</code></pre>

            <p>Lets assume that this is implemented as a linked list in memory. The head will be <code>1</code> and tail
                will be <code>4</code>. Its representation will be <code>1 =&gt; 2 =&gt; 3 =&gt; 4</code>. Now we have
                to change the first value to <code>0</code>. So the required representation will be <code>0 =&gt; 2 =&gt;
                    3 =&gt; 4</code>. As you can see that apart from one value the rest are the same. The programming
                language intelligently uses the same memory for the common values and just point the head to a different
                value. This is how persistent data structures work. Well I agree that there is still some mmeory
                overhead compared to in place mutation, but the actualy overhead is greatly reduced by using this
                method.</p>

            <h3>Use of immutability in Concurrent Programming</h3>

            <p>It is also seems that using immutable values helps a great deal in concurrent programming. Anyone who has
                done concurrent programming in Java or C# will know about the pain of avoiding deadlocks and corruption
                of values. We have to make sure that one thread doesnt modify a variable when another thread is using
                it. This was accomplished using locks. But recently programming languages have improved a lot in their
                support for concurrent programming but still it leaves us wanted for more in some cases. But when a
                variable is immutable, we can be 100% sure that it will never be changed and hence there is no need of
                locks and no memory corruption will be possible.</p>

            <h2>2. First Class Functions</h2>

            <p>A language is said to have first class functions if it treats functions as first class citizens. WTH was
                that? Well, it means that you can store a function in a variable and pass it around like a normal
                variable containing an int or a string. You can pass it to functions, return it from a function, you can
                have a list of functions. This method of programming enables programming with a higher level of
                abstraction because you have the ability to pass functions (code logic) which are no longer tied to
                instances of a class as in object oriented world. You can also create anonymous functions which small
                utility functions where giving them a name doesnt make much sense. First class functions enables the
                concept of higher order functions which are functions that takes functions as parameters. Higher-order
                functions are very useful for refactoring code and reduce the amount of repetition. We will see more
                about higher order functions when we see about functions in Haskell.</p>

            <h2>3. Referential Transparency</h2>

            <p>In a functional programming language every line of code is an expression. Not a statement. A statement
                does something but need not return anything. But an expression should always return a value. This is in
                sync with the mathematical concept of expressions. A referentially transparent function should always
                return the same result for a particular value of an input. i.e. At any time, for a particule input, the
                replacement of the function call should not affect the execution of a program. Lets see an example.</p>

<pre><code>public int square(int number){
    return number * number
    }
</code></pre>

            <p>The above function is referentially transparent as for a value of <code>number</code> it is always going
                to return its square. For example, we can replace <code>square(4)</code> with <code>16</code> and be
                assured that the program will run correctly. Function calls can be memoized if they are referentially
                transparent.</p>

            <h2>4. Purity</h2>

            <p>Some language allow functions to interact with external components apart from returning values. Such
                languages are called as impure languages. What is meant by interacting with external components? Well,
                printing to screen, writing to file etc are called cas side effects. They are used to convey something
                to the outside world. This is called as impurity. Woah. Wait. If haskell is a pure programming language
                then it cant write to console or file? Then how is it going to be useful? Well, the answer is, yes
                haskell is a pure programming language and it allows you to interact with the external world through a
                special set of constructs, the use of which is limited and hence provide a clear separation between the
                main logic of the program and side effects. We will see how haskell does that when we read about
                monads.</p>

            <h2>5. Lazy Evaluation</h2>

            <p>Since pure computations are referentially transparent they can be performed at any time and still yield
                the same result. This makes it possible to defer the computation of values until they are needed, that
                is, to compute them lazily. Lazy evaluation avoids unnecessary computations and allows, for example,
                infinite data structures to be defined and used. LINQ in C# uses lazy evaluation techniques.
                <code>[1..]</code> is an infinite array in haskell. But wont it cause stack overflow? Well, no. Because
                it will not be evaluated untill some other function uses it. <code>take 5 [1..]</code> will result in
                <code>[1,2,3,4,5]</code>. <code>take</code> is a function that takes two paramters. A number and an
                array and results in the number of items taken from the top of that array.</p>

            <h2>6. Recursion</h2>

            <p>If loops are not allowed in functional programming languages because loops function based on mutating of
                variables, then how are we going to do some repeated logic on some complex data structures? The answer
                is recursion. Recursion is the concpet of a function calling itself. Recursion in languages without tail
                call optimization usually results in stack overflow for large sets of data. Haskell is tail call
                optimized and we will see what that is while reading more about recursion later.</p>

            <p>Well haskell supports all of the above and hence it is a pure lazy functional programming language.
                Functional programs are often shorter and easier to understand than their imperative counterparts. Also
                once familiar, they increase the productivity of a programmer.</p>

            <h2>Specific Features of Haskell</h2>

            <p>Apart from the above features, haskell is also a statically type programming language which means that
                every expression you type in haskell is type safe and verified by the compiler before run time which
                greatky reduces the probability of bugs. It is usually said that once your code compiles in haskell,
                there is a very good chance it will work perfectly. (only if you code the logic correctly). A constant
                argument against statically typed programming language is that it tends to be very verbose by supplying
                type information everywhere in order to help the compiler. But programs written in haskell seldom use
                type information(usually type information is given as a practice only for method signatures that are
                exposed outside). This is possible because of the Hindley-Milner algorithm that haskell uses to infer
                types. I am not going to get into the details of this because I dont know much about it. If you are
                interested, google is always there.</p>
