                            Hi All !!!
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am Aravindh.S. I am Indian living in Chennai, India. I am an automobile engineer by education,
                            a software developer by profession, a maths teacher by passion and a pancreatitis patient by fate. I work as a
                            Senior Consultant - Developer in an awesome company called <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com"><b>Thought</b>Works</a>. I also teach mathematics to 10th grade students
                            in a private educational institution near my house.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have been developing software for the past four years
                            using .NET and microsoft technologies viz C#, ASP.NET MVC, WPF, SQL Server 2008.
                            My interests revolve around learning about programming languages and their inner workings.
                            I am constantly on the look out for new programming constructs that would make coding a pleasure.
                            Off late I am reading two languages viz. Scala and Haskell. While Haskell is a pure functional programming
                            language, Scala mixes both functional and object oriented paradigms in an elegant way which no language
                            has managed to do so far.
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I am a great fan of changing operating system once a week in my laptop. I generally
                            install a new operating system to check its stability, user experience, software support etc. Most of the
                            operating systems will be a variant of linux and sometimes OS X developer versions. I am also a gadget freak.
                            A smartphone freak to be particular. The current phone I am using (Nexus 5) is my 13th mobile phone and 7th
                            smartphone. What will happen to old phones? God only knows :P
                            </br>
                            </br>
                            &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I like playing badminton and like watching cricket. I am also a huge fan of the manga series Dragon Ball Z. My
                            ultimate achievement would be when I am able to do some help to the human community and since I am a software developer, I would
                            like that to happen via some software product. Not just any product, but something that helps the community. Anyone can get product ideas,
                            anyone can implement them, but implementing an idea that helps the human community will always have a special place in my mind and thats the
                            one I shall strive towards.
