##Get, Set, Goooooooo!
With the development environment completely set, we are good to start our journey on learning haskell. Hope you find it interesting and intriguing. 

## Basics
In this section we will see the basics of haskell programming language. When you complete this, you will be able to solve small problems may involve mathematical calculations, basic haskell data types, boolean logic, small loops (oops. not loops. comprehensions), read data from the REPL, print data to the REPL, how to create an list and manipulate its contents

###Numbers
Numbers in haskell include fixed and arbitrary precision numbers, integers, floating points and ratios. You can do basic arithmetic directly in the haskell REPL.
